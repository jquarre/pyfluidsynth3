class FluidEvent():
    ''' Represents the FluidSynth event object as defined in event.h.

    This class is inspired by the FluidEvent object from pyfluidsynth by MostAwesomeDude. Method
    documentation is mostly taken from FluidSynth's official API.

    Member:
    dest -- The destination field of a sequencer (short).
    event -- The FluidSynth event object (fluid_event_t).
    handle -- The handle to the FluidSynth library. Should be FluidHandle but a raw handle will
              probably work, too (FluidHandle).
    source -- The source field of a sequencer (short).
