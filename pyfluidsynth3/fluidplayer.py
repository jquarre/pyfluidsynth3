class FluidPlayer():

    This class is inspired by the FluidPlayer object from pyfluidsynth by MostAwesomeDude. Method
    documentation is mostly taken from FluidSynth's official API.

    Member:
    handle -- The handle to the FluidSynth library. Should be FluidHandle but a raw handle will
              probably work, too (FluidHandle).
    paused -- Indicates if the player is playing or inactive (boolean).
    player -- The FluidSynth player object (fluid_player_t).
